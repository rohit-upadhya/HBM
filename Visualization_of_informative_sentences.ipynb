about 6.53 a.m. on 28 September 1994, my husband, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, left our house.\",\n"," \"His van was going to pick up the workmen outside MÃ¼slÃ¼m Olcay's coffee house to take them to the

there was nothing obstructing my view of it.',\n"," 'I knew that the van driver was Mesut Å\\x9een, but did not know the workmen.',\n"," 'As my husband, Mehmet Salih Sabuktekin, got into the van alongside the driver, two people came up and fired shots, but I was unable to work out whether my husband was the target.',\n"," 'At that point a person I did not know arrived and told me that my husband had been shot.',\n"," 'One of the assailants was stout and short.',\n"," 'The other was slim and approximately 1 metre 70 tall.',\n"," 'I did not see their faces.',\n"," 'From what I heard,

husband.',\n"," 'They disappeared round the corner of the road just next to me.',\n"," 'They were holding pistols.',\n"," 'My brother-in-law, Halil Sabuktekin, arrived and told me that my husband had been shot.',\n"," 'I did not see Halil run after the suspects.',\n"," 'When he got up to me he fainted.',\n"," 'I wanted to help him recover his senses and at the same time to follow the suspects, but

him which way they had gone, he said that he had not seen them.',\n"," 'To be precise, he said that they had run off and that there was no point in giving chase, as I would never be able to catch them up.',\n"," 'No one stopped me when I tried to chase them.',\n"," 'In any event, I was the only person who sought to follow the suspects.',\n"," 'Three or four years before my husband was killed, there was an investigation.',\n"," 'My husband was taken into police custody but was not detained.',\n"," 'He was questioned about a person named RÄ±fat and another workman, who were working on one of the building sites in the sub-prefecture of Karatas.',\n"," 'RÄ±fat and the other workman were suspected of being members of the PKK and I think my husband was suspected of helping them.',\n"," 'I repeat

Commission] that my brother-in-law, Halil Sabuktekin, was prevented from chasing after the suspects by plainclothes police officers.\",\n"," 'I do not know where they obtained that information.',\n"," 'I did not say that in my deposition of 15 April 1998, as it is not true and I was not asked about that subject.',\n"," 'We buried the deceased the day he was killed.',\n"," 'At about 5 a.m. the following day, I noticed someone in the fields, about 250 metres from my home, and another person walk past my house.',\n"," 'I think that they were police officers, but they were not wearing

nothing else to say.',\n"," \"'â\\x80\\x9d 58.\",\n"," 'On the afternoon of 18 November 1998, the Public Prosecutor took the following statement from Ali Acar: â\\x80\\x9cAt about 3.30 p.m. today, police officers, accompanied by a person who I did not know beforehand but whom I subsequently learnt was Mrs Sultane Sabuktekin, came to my house.',\n"," \"Pointing at me, Sultane said 'I am not

knew among those who had been present.',\n"," 'He could not remember whether his brother, Ekrem Turan, who was also working on the building site to which they were all going, was present that morning.',\n"," 'Ekrem Turan was later questioned, but stated that he was not at the scene of the murder as he had taken the day off work.',\n"," 'The rules and procedures applicable to liability for

suggest that a death is not due to natural causes, members of the security forces who have been informed of that fact are required to advise the public prosecutor or a criminal-court judge (Article 152 CCP).',\n"," 'A public prosecutor who is informed by any means whatsoever of a situation that gives rise to suspicion that an offence has been committed has a duty to investigate the facts in order to decide whether or not a prosecution should be brought (Article 153 CCP).',\n"," 'Under section 13 of Law no.',\n"," '2577 on Administrative Procedure, anyone who sustains damage as a result of an act by the authorities may, within one year after the alleged act was committed, claim compensation from them.',\n"," 'If the claim is rejected in whole or in part or if no reply is received within sixty days, the victim may bring administrative proceedings.',\n"," 'Article 125 Â§Â§ 1 and 7 of the Constitution provides: â\\x80\\x9cAll acts or decisions of the authorities are subject to judicial review...',\n"," \"The authorities shall be liable to make reparation for all damage caused by their acts or measures.â\\x80\\x9d That provision establishes the State's strict liability, which comes into play if it is shown that in the circumstances of a particular case the State has failed in its obligation to maintain public order, ensure public safety or protect people's lives or property, without it being necessary to show a tortious act attributable to the authorities.\",\n"," 'Under these rules, the authorities may therefore be held liable to compensate anyone who has sustained loss as a result of acts committed by unidentified persons.',\n"," 'Under the Code of Obligations, anyone who suffers damage as a result of an illegal or tortious act may bring an action for damages for pecuniary loss (Articles 41 to 46) and non-pecuniary loss (Article 47).',\n"," \"The civil courts are not bound by either the findings or the verdict of the criminal courts on the issue of

the Constitution and Articles 55 and 100 of the Code of Obligations).',\n"," 'That is not, however, an absolute rule.',\n"," \"When an act is found to be illegal or tortious and, consequently, is no longer an â\\x80\\x9cadministrativeâ\\x80\\x9d act or deed, the civil courts may allow a claim for damages to be made against the official concerned, without prejudice to the victim's right to bring
